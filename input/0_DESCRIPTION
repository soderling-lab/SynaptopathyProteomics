This directory (/input) contains files the raw data for the analysis.

Peptide intensity data were exported as an excel document from Proteome 
Discover. Please note that the data exported by default from PD is a 
unitless signal to noise ratio which should not be used for 
quantitative analysis.

Sample information about mice used to prepare synaptosomes from cortex and 
striatum are in the 'csv' combined traits files.
