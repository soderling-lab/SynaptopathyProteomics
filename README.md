# Synaptopathy-Proteomics
Analysis of synaptosome TMT proteomics from __Shank2__, __Shank3__, 
__Syngap1__, and __Ube3a__ mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Main directories:
* Bin - executable scripts for the project.
* Code - the code that performs the projects analysis.
* Input - the input data.

Additional directories:
Several other directories are generated during the executation of the analysis:
* RData - directory for storing intermediate RData files.
* Figures - directory for figure output from scripts.
* Tables - directory for table output from scripts. 
* venv - Python3 virual environment for reproducibility of Python scripts.
Due to the potential for these directories to get really big, they are not 
managed by git (see `.gitignore`).
