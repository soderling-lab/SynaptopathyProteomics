## TODO: generate plots.

# [INTRA-Experiment processing]
#     Peptide-level operations:
#     | * SL normalization --> visualize with boxplots
#     | * Remove QC outliers --> hist of ratios and scatter plot
#     | * Impute missing values
#     Protein-level proessing:
#     | * Summarize proteins
#     | * SL normalization
#     | * Remove intra-batch batch-effect. --> pca of a batch
# [INTER-Experiment operations]
#     | * Remove QC sample outliers --> should be some plotting code in the old code
#     | * IRS normalization --> visualze a single protein before and after IRS.
#     | * Filter proteins
#     | * Protein imputing
# [edgeR STATISTICAL analysis]
#     | * Final TMM normalization
#     | * GLM for differential abundance.
