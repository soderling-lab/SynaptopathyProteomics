# Potential ways of building a network.

* Combine WT and KO data from both tissues --> concensus network.
  Enforce module preservation. Analyze modules for diff exp (kw test).

* Cortex and striatum networks. Build by combining WT and KO data from each
* tissue. Compare networks in order to identify preserved and divergent modules.
Divergent modules may be tissue type specific.
Modules may be analyzed for differential abundance.
Comparison of Cortex and striatum reveals that there are no (?) divergent modules.
There are a few preserved modules at all resolutions.
Is it better to combine into one network or analyze seperately?

* Seperate WT and KO networks. Built by combining WT and KO data from both
* tissues. Enforce module preservation in WT and KO graphs seperately, and then
* compare by permutation test in order to identify preserved and divergent
* modules. Can we anlyze preserved modules for expression changes? There are a
* small number of weakly (?) divergent modules. These seem to interconnected by
* PPIs, but do not appear partically enriched for major GO terms. Prominent
* divergent module is enriched for cytoplasmic (?) stuff.
Analysis of WT and KO graphs seperately reveals that WT and KO graphs are mostly
preserved!
