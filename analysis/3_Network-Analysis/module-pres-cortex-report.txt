Loading SynaptopathyProteomics
Evaluating self-preservation of Cortex modules in the Cortex network.
Module statistic(s) used to evaluate module preservation: avg.weight, coherence, avg.cor, avg.contrib.
Criterion for module preservation/divergence: strong.

Working on partition 1 of 1 ...
... 115 of 157 modules are preserved.
Done!
