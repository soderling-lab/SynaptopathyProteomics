_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Copies a subset of nodes and edges into a newly created
     subnetwork.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     createSubnetwork(
       nodes = NULL,
       nodes.by.col = "SUID",
       edges = NULL,
       edges.by.col = "SUID",
       exclude.edges = FALSE,

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

   nodes: list of node names or keyword: selected, unselected or all.
          Default is currently selected nodes.

nodes.by.col: name of node table column corresponding to provided nodes
          list; default is 'SUID'

   edges: list of edge names or keyword: selected, unselected or all.
          Default is currently selected edges.

edges.by.col: name of edge table column corresponding to provided edges
          list; default is 'SUID'

exclude.edges: (boolean) whether to exclude connecting edges; default
          is FALSE

subnetwork.name: name of new subnetwork to be created; default is to
          add a numbered suffix to source network name

 network: (optional) Name or SUID of the network. Default is the
          "current" network active in Cytoscape.

base.url: (optional) Ignore unless you need to specify a custom domain,
          port or version to connect to the CyREST API. Default is
          http://localhost:1234 and the latest version of the CyREST
          API supported by this version of RCy3.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If you spe@param base.url (optional) Ignore unless you need to
     specify a custom domain, port or version to connect to the CyREST
     API. Default is http://localhost:1234 and the latest version of
     the CyREST API supported by this version of RCy3.cify both nodes
     and edges, the resulting subset will be the union of those sets.
     Typical usage only requires specifying either nodes or edges. Note
     that selected nodes will bring along their connecting edges by
     default (see exclude.edges arg) and selected edges will always
     bring along their source and target nodes.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     SUID of new subnetwork

     createSubnetwork(c("AKT1","TP53","PIK3CA"),"display name")
     createSubnetwork(edges="all") #subnetwork of all connected nodes
