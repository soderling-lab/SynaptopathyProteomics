# Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

tuning of wgcna parameters using sequential model based optimization

* define a model
* decide which parameters wo optimized
* define an objective function for minimization
* define bounds of the search space to be explored

* WGCNA - a black box function, that is expensive to evaluate, y = f(x) is noisy.

LOOP:
* Integrate all possible true functions using gp regression.
* optimize cheap acq funciton u based on posterior distribution for samping the next point.

plot convergence as min of f(x) after n calls
