## Differential Expression
Proteins with FDR less than 0.05 were considered differentially expressed.

### Shank2
Cortex = 79
Striatum = 7
Overlap = 1 (Shank2)

Lack of differentially expressed proteins in Striatum may reflect the lack of
expression of Shank2 in striatum tissue (REF).

Combined 

### Shank3
Cortex = 628 !
Striatum = 104
Overlap = 22

Clyd - deubiquitinase that clease Lys-63 down regulated in both tissues.
Homer1 - Shank3 binding protein, downregulated in striatum tissue.
Fblx16 - SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein)-type E3 ubiquitin ligase complex member.

Combined cortex and striatum differentially abundant proteins were enriched for
mitochondrial associated processes.

Anks1b - putative Syngap1 interacting protein (Wilkinson et al., 2017).
Recently shown that loss of Anks1b in mice causes
 social deficits, hyperactivity, and sensorimotor dysfunction.

Tars, and Psmd proteins dysregulated = up.

### Ube3a
Cortex = 266
Striatum = 306
Overlap = 87
Strong enrichment of proteasome.
