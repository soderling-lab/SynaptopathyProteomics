# Introduction

In the past three decades, human genetic studies have identified hundreds of
gene variants associated with risk to neurodevelopmental and neurological 
disorders. An emerging realization from these studies is that a large 
fraction of human brain disorders results from genetic variation in genes 
which encode synaptic proteins. Although these studies have provided a 
framework for interrogating the mechanisms of synaptic function in health 
and disease, many of the underlying molecular, cellular, and circuit pathological
mechanisms engaged across a diverse spectrum of human brain disorders remains obscure. 
Proteomics has emerged as an approach to discover and quantify synaptic proteomes.
