# Abstract

Synapses are the most abundant and distinguishing feature of the brain,
providing enormous functional diversity and plasticity to neural circuits. In
the last several decades, human genetics have unveiled mutations associated with
many developmental brain disorders (DBDs). These mutations are highly prevalent
in genes that encode synaptic proteins, leading to the emerging realization that
many complex neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders may converge
mechanistically as synaptopathiesâ€”diseases of the synapse. However, whether
there are synaptic perturbations that are shared or distinct between genetic
mutations driving these disorders is unknown. Here we analyze the molecular
composition of synapses from cortex and striatum tissue across four distinct
mouse models of DBDs using deep quantitative TMT proteomics and weighted protein
co-expression network analysis. We find each model harbors unique signatures of
synaptic abnormalities that may drive pathogenesis as well as convergence at the
network level between modules of co-expressed proteins. These results strongly
support gene-centric approaches to understanding the underlying biology driving
DBDs, with implications for therapeutic approaches informed by genomic burden.
